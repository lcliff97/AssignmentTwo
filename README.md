- I've been watching a lot of 'Bro Code' content on YouTube, he primarily covers JavaScript, which is definitely what I am struggling with at the moment, I have a handle on how the functions and features JS offers work, and how they relate to one another, I still don't have a handle on how to write them correctly. I find the structuring of adding event listerners, or creating general functions to be confusing, and I often make syntax errors that I don't understand. His channel has been greta at explaining these functions, but I still need a lot more practice with the very basic and fundamental JS concepts.
  
- I have used ChatGPT to review my code (I know, I know, lock me up and throw away the key), this is mainly so I can see an alternate way of structuring information, or so I can understand syntax errors, say for instances not referencing my images as a string for example - or having a function duplicated multiple times that causes JS to overlook the first two instances of the function. If I'm really stuck I try consolidate the code ChatGPT displays with what I've been taught in class (or found on YouTube channels) and then write my own code based off an amalgamtion of the sources.

Error & What Went Well & What Didn't

- On a positive note I am now more confident with CSS just by comparatively to how tricky I'm finding JS, but what this exercise has helped me with is understanding the relstionships between different features of JS, I understand WHY someone would set about their data in an array, why this is useful when creating a function, or adding a click event etc. Learning the conepts in isolation is difficult for me, primarily because I like to see how things tangibly work, what their utility is in practice. I think this is more useful than workshops that focus on one topic, the way features interlink with one another drives home what they are and importantly for me, precisely how and why they work.

- Honestly, this project has been very difficult for me, this last week I feel I have been playing catch up, as I've been watching JS videos in my spare time, but not much has been sinking in, because I'm constantly inundated with new information. I understand the nature of the bootcamp is fast paced and intensive, but I like to have a bit of a slower approach to understand things and be a little more hands on. Because of this I find myself watching content on topics that have already been discussed that day whilst in workshops, this has really highlighted how much work I need to put into JS.
